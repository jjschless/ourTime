=== Prologue ===

Hi! I'm JJ and I've recently started learning web development. As part of that process I'm building some projects that to practice the process. 

This is a full stack project that focuses on JavaScript from front to back with a Mongo database. This is just the first iteration. The goal is to create a functional CRUD site with a database and then clone the repository and for various improvements and additional technology. I also plan on integrating an SQL database in a different clone.

I have an overall vision for this app. How it ought to look and function: I'd like it to be a simple, single page PWA that I can make use of to track freelance hours spent on each project. Or even my own projects. I'd like to know how long certain tasks take me so that I have an idea of what to charge.

I'll add additional readme chapters as I progress through both my learning and project progress. 

Currently I am learning through a variety of Udemy video courses. I've spent about $130 on an array of courses -- all on sale of course.
